LO1: Assess risks to IT security 
P1: Identify types of security risks to organizations. 
What is Risk? 
According to the traditional way of thinking, "risk is damage, loss, danger or factors related to danger, difficulty or uncertainty that can happen to people, asset " 
Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Asset 
-	IT risks include hardware and software failure, human error, spam, viruses and malicious attacks, as well as natural disasters such as fires, cyclones or floods. 
-	types of risks: 
•	Strategic Risk: Strategic risks are risks arising from management decisions related to business objectives. Basically, strategic risk is the risk of not meeting the objectives of the proposed business. 
•	compliance risk: is a risk of violation of regulations; significant financial losses; Reputable loss and legal risk that an organization incurs due to non-compliance. 
•	Financial risks: are risks related to financial devaluation (also known as financial price risk) and risks from making financial decisions affecting the profitability of the business.  
•	“Operational risk: is the risk of causing losses due to human causes, inadequacy or inadequate operation of processes and systems; external objective events”. 
•	Environmental risks: are actual or potential threats that affect living organisms and the environment through waste water, waste gas, waste, or resource depletion, etc. due to the operation of an 
application. certain organization or organization (Crawford & Company, 2016) 
•	Technical risks: are risks due to technical errors in the process of asset payment. 
•	Risk management: is the process of approaching risks in a scientific and systematic way to identify, control, prevent and minimize losses, losses and adverse effects of risks while seeking ways turning risk into success opportunities 
P2: Describe organizational security procedures. 
The ultimate goal of information security is to protect the three attributes of information: 
-	Confidentiality (Confidential) - Information is only viewed by authorized people. The reason to keep information confidential is because it is the product of the organization and sometimes it is the information of the organization's customers. This information must be kept confidential or in accordance with the terms of the organization and its customers. 
-	Integrity - Information must not be corrupted, degraded, or changed. Information needs to be treated to isolate from intentional accidents or changes. 
-	Availability - Information must always be kept in a state ready to provide to authorized personnel when they need it. 
Now let's do the organization's security procedures 
Step 1: Identify and prioritize assets 
The property here is server, customer information, partner's confidential documents, business secrets, etc. And remember that you are a security engineer so you need to work with customers and manage business to create a list of all valuable assets. For each asset, collect the following information, if any: 
•	Software 
•	Hardware 
•	Data 
•	Display 
•	User 
•	Mission or purpose 
•	require function 
•	IT security policy 
•	IT security architecture 
•	Network structure 
•	Information storage protection 
•	Information flow 
•	Technical security control 
•	Physical security environment 
•	Environmental security 
-	whereby assets need to be identified and protected as currencies, databases, user profiles, etc. 
Step 2: Identify threats 
Threat is that anything can exploit the vulnerability to breach security and harm your organization. Although hackers and viruses can harm you, there are many other types of threats: 
-	Natural disaster. Floods, storms, earthquakes, fires and other natural disasters can cause more damage to you than a hacker. 
-	System error. The possibility of a system error depends on the quality of the technology equipment you use. For new, high quality equipment, the possibility of a system error is very low. But if the device is old or purchased by an unknown source, the possibility of a system error will be higher. Therefore, buy high quality equipment or good support equipment. 
-	Human intervention. This threat is always placed at a high level, no matter what field you are working in. Anyone can make a mistake like accidentally deleting important files, clicking on the malware link or accidentally damaging the program or device. Therefore, you should back up your data and configure the system at the highest security level. 
-	Malicious people. There are three malicious behaviours: 
*	Intervention is when someone attacks your business by deleting data, denying distributed services (DDOS) to your site, stealing components or losing server data. 
*	Intercept is a hack where they steal your data. 
*	Impersonation is to use other people's information for malicious purposes, such as cyberattacks or black-market disputes. 
Step 3: Determine the vulnerability 
We need to discover the vulnerability. A vulnerability is a weakness that hackers can threaten to exploit and use and violate security and cause damage to your business. Vulnerabilities can be identified through analysis of auditors, audit reports, NIST vulnerability databases, vendor data, commercial computer incident response groups and security analysis. System software confidentiality. test and evaluate vulnerabilities: 
-	Procedures for checking and evaluating information security (ST & E)  
-	Penetration inspection technique 
-	Automatic vulnerability scanning tool 
Step 4: Assess the Impact a Threat Could Have 
• Impact analysis should include the following elements: 
-	The mission of the system, including processes implemented by the system 
-	The importance of the system, determined by its value and the value of the data to the organization 
-	Sensitivity of the system and its data 
• The following additional items should be included in the impact analysis: 
-	The estimated frequency of the threat of exploiting the vulnerability on an annual basis 
-	Approximate cost of each occurrence 
-	A weight factor is based on the relative impact of a specific threat exploiting a specific vulnerability 
 
Step 5: Determine the possibility of an incident 
-	evaluate a loophole and thereby put in place control measures. Instead of score, many organizations use high, medium and low categories to assess the possibility of attack or other adverse events. 
Step 6: Control analysis 
Analysis of controls to minimize exploiting threats of system vulnerabilities, control over technical means 
-	There are two types of controls: technical and non-technical controls that can be classified into preventive or detective controls. 
Step 7: Prioritize information security risks 
For each type of threat / vulnerability, first determine the risk for the IT system, based on the following analysis: 
-	The threat ability will exploit the vulnerability 
-	The impact of the threat successfully exploiting the vulnerability 
-	The adequacy of existing information system security controls or planned to eliminate or minimize risks 
Step 8: Offer control 
• Here are some general guidelines for each level of risk: 
-	High - planning for early remedies 
-	Medium - planning corrective measures and being implemented within a reasonable time. 
-	Low - must decide to take the risk of corrective actions. 
Step 9: Document the Results 
P3: Identify the potential impact to IT security risk to organizations 
What is network attack? 
- 	A cyber-attack is the act of attacking target computer information systems, infrastructure, computer networks or personal computer devices, hackers use different methods to steal, change or destroy information system data. 
• types of network attacks: 
-	Denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks 
-	Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack 
-	Phishing and spear phishing attacks 
-	Drive-by attack 
-	Password attack 
-	SQL injection attack 
-	Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack 
-	Eavesdropping attack 
-	Birthday attack 
-	Malware attack 
• effects of network attacks: effects of cyberattacks: 
1.	Physical aspects 
When a network security problem occurs, the hardware device of the individual or organization may be damaged, flickering, and not working properly. 
2.	Loss, damage, modification of information 
One of the most worries of the Company whenever an information security incident is lost, corrupted or changed. More dangerous, hackers can steal all data and force victims to pay ransom. 
3.	The risk of being attacked by malware 
Hackers can use many different attack techniques to hack into the system: Phishing, virus, spyware, man in middle. 
4.	The risk of information insecurity due to using Email and social networks 
5.	The risk of information insecurity for the Website 
Some damages due to insecurity of information for the Website may be hijacked, hacked to the web, the website hangs inaccessible, the website interface is changed, dirty links are inserted, attacked Dos, lost project documents, lost customer lists ... 
P4: Discuss the benefits to implement network monitoring systems with supporting reasons 
Top Benefits of Network Monitoring 
1.  Stay ahead of outages 
- 	Implementing network monitoring is one of the most basic and simple ways to prevent these outages from occurring in the first place. 
2. Fix issues faster 
- 	In a down situation, time is money. Network monitoring makes it easier and faster to solve problems for network professionals. 
3. Gain immediate ROI 
- 	 The right network monitoring tool can bring ROI right away. Without delving into network performance, employees who have time to return to work on more important projects. And ahead of IT downtime helps reduce downtime costs for your organization. 
4.	Manage to grow, changing networks 
5.	Identify security threats 
6.	Justify equipment upgrades 
7.	Report on SLAs 
LO3 Review mechanisms to control organizational IT security P5 Discuss risk assessment procedures. 
What is a risk assessment? 
Risk assessment is an important and necessary element to manage safety and health and the main goal is to identify and establish the necessary measures to comply with the Health and Safety laws and regulations. Relevant regulations by reducing the incident / accident level. 
Risk assessment includes the following steps: 
Step 1: Identify hazards 
-	The danger is something potentially harmful 
-	Hazards can be determined by means of walking around the workplace or asking employees 
Step 2: Decide who can be harmed and how 
-	Determine the target of harm 
Step 3: Risk assessment and decision of control measures 
-	Protect the target from harm and control the consequences of not causing injury and make sure the danger is completely eliminated 
Step 4: Record your findings 
-	record findings that show you have identified a hazard, decide who is harmed and plan to eliminate risks and hazards 
Step 5: Review your review and update as needed 
P6: Explain data protection processes and regulations as applicable to an organization.

What is CIA Triad of Information Security? 
-	Security, integrity and availability are the CIA trio, which is designed to generalize content about information security policies within an organization. The model is called 
the AIC triplet (availability, integrity and security). The elements of the security triad are considered the three most important components of security. 
Confidentiality ensures that only authorized parties with sufficient privileges may view the information. 
-	For example, to ensure user privacy, account or password numbers need to be encrypted, or two-factor authentication, or software token when logging in. 
 Integrity ensures that the data stored on devices is correct and no unauthorized persons or malicious software has altered data. 
-	for example, security breaches such as file access and user control, short of blocking false changes or deletion due to user confusion 
 Availability ensures network resources are readily accessible to authorized users. 
-	For example, it is necessary to back up the system in the face isolation position as in a waterproof fire-proof safe, adding a firewall P7: Discuss security legislation and policy by organizations 
What Is a Security Policy? 
-	Privacy policy is a written document stored in an organization that records how to protect the organization from threats, such as computer security and how to handle situations when they occur. 
-	The privacy policy must identify the company's assets and potential hazards to the property. Company employees need to know about those policies and update them regularly These three principles compose the CIA triad: 
•	Confidentiality involves the protection of assets from unauthorized entities 
•	Integrity ensures the modification of assets is handled in a specified and authorized manner 
•	Availability is a state of the system in which authorized users have continuous access to said assets 
P8: List the main components of an organizational disaster recovery plan, justifying the reasons for inclusion. 
what is Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)? 
-	Disaster Recovery Planning DRP is an element of internal control systems to manage availability and restore critical processes in the event of interruption  
-	DRP is a continuous planning process to use cost-effective controls to prevent possible disruptions and recover the capacity of the organization 
Recovery strategy 
RTO describes the time and goals that business applications can stop working, measured in hours, minutes or seconds. The RPO describes the time before the application must be restored. 
-	Recovery strategy defines an organization's plans to respond to disasters, while disaster recovery plans describe how organizations should respond. 
-	When determining recovery strategies, organizations should consider issues such as: 
•	Budget 
•	Resources - people and facilities 
•	Risk management position 
•	Technology 
•	Data 
•	Provider 
-	Steps for disaster recovery planning 
Risk analysis and business impact analysis help identify where to focus personnel and factors in the disaster recovery planning process. BIA determines the impact of disruptive events. It also creates RTO and RPO. RA identifies threats 
-	DR plan checklist includes the following steps: 
•	Setting up the scope of activities; 
•	Collect relevant network infrastructure documents; 
•	Identify the most serious threats and vulnerabilities and the most important assets; 
•	Review the history of unexpected incidents and outages, and how they are handled; 
•	Identify current DR strategies; 
•	Identify emergency response teams; 
•	Have management review and approve disaster recovery plan; 
•	Check the plan; 
•	Update the plan; and Implementation of DR audit plan. Create a disaster recovery plan 
- 	DR's plan is to identify the roles and responsibilities of disaster recovery team members to set the criteria to put the plan into operation. Important elements of disaster recovery plan include: 
•	Declaration of intent and policy statement DR; 
•	Plan objectives; 
•	Authentication tools, such as passwords; 
•	Geographic risks and factors; 
•	Tips for dealing with media; 
•	Financial and legal information and action steps; and 
•	Historical plan. 
Scope and objectives of DR plan 
-	A disaster recovery plan can range from basic to comprehensive. 
-	Disaster recovery budget can vary greatly and fluctuate over time. 
-	The disaster recovery plan checklist includes identifying critical IT systems and networks, prioritizing RTOs and outlining the steps needed to restart, reconfigure and restore systems and networks. 
-	Distance is an important, but often overlooked, element of the DR planning process. 
Types of specific disaster recovery plans 
DR plans are tailored to a specific environment. 
-	Disaster virtualization plan. Virtualization provides the opportunity to fix disaster in a more efficient and simple way. 
-	Network disaster recovery plan. Develop a network recovery plan that becomes more complex as network complexity increases. 
-	Cloud disaster recovery plan. Cloud-based disaster recovery can range from a data backup in the cloud to a complete copy. 
Types of disasters 
A disaster recovery plan protects an organization from both man-made disasters and natural disasters. Types of disasters: 
Application failed - 	Error VM 
-	Server error 
-	Price error 
-	Communication error 
-	Disaster data center 
-	Disaster construction 
-	Disaster on campus 
-	City-wide disaster 
-	Regional disaster 
-	National disaster 
-	Multinational disaster
